Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompt Templates for EVI Agent System

CoT (Chain of Thought): A prompting technique that guides AI to break down complex 
reasoning into step-by-step thinking processes, improving accuracy and transparency.

Each agent uses CoT prompts to:
1. Structure their analysis systematically
2. Show reasoning process explicitly  
3. Arrive at well-reasoned conclusions
